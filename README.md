## Environment and Setup
First things first, make sure your computer is setup to run and build ReactNative applications
* ReactNative environment setup - [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)


## Getting Started

Clone the repo onto your machine.

Next,

> Make sure you're using node > v20

If you have NVM installed on your machine the `.nvmrc` file would pick up the right version when you run `nvm use` from the terminal.


Otherwise follow [this article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-version-manager-nvm-install-guide/) to install nvm on your computer.

## Run Application
* Install dependencies - 
      Run `yarn` to install dependencies. Once that's done install ios pods by running `cd ios && pod install` from project root
* Switch branch to `dev` or `main` as they contain the latest code
* Start development server - Run `yarn start` from project root [ select `a` for android and `i` for iOS ]

## FOR ENV DATA
Pleas reach out to me on this mail: [thenelsonmichael@gmail.com](mailto:thenelsonmichael@gmail.com) to get the env data as it is sensitive data I don't want to be in the public. The example env file should show you what to expect.
